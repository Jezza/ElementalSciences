+ Added Creative Tab: Machines.
+ Added Creative Tab: Misc.
+ Added Chamber Casing.
< Chamber Casing now has Connected Textures.
+ Added Laser Emitters. (Pretty much code from buildcraft, for now :3)
+ Added Power Conduits.
+ Added Power Emitters, used for the multiblock, So I'll remove this from the creative soon.
+ Added Storage Chamber. Think ZPM, but a multiblock. See if you can work it out. :P
< Changed a lot of textures.
< Power Emitter and Linear Emitter are now properly directional, like a piston.
< Power Conduits now render properly.

Notes:  Started mucking around with TileEntities, yay! :D
        Expect a use for power conduits and Hadron Collider Pipes soon. :P

---- v0.0.009 ----
* Pipes no longer connect to the top of the Hadron Sensor.
* Pipes no longer connect to the wrong side of the Emitter.
* Fixed a chunk of bugs.
< Linear Accelerator is now know as Linear Emitter.
< Linear Emitter is now a directional block, EG, A Furnace.
> Linear Accelerator will be back, but as something cooler.
< Texture Change!!! :D
- Removed my broken heart: Aang and Katara. <3
Notes: I don't know if I'm happy with the new textures for the pipe..

---- v0.0.008 ----
+ Added the Hadron Sensor, later use.
+ Added Linear Accelerator.
* Fixed a massive bug with the help of MinAlien.. :D
* Fixed pipes.
* Fixed another grav pad glitch.
Notes: PIPES ARE NO LONGER BUGGY, well, as buggy... Finally got them working. By working, I mean, rendering correctly. At least, until I break them again. :/

---- v0.0.007 ----
+ Began work on the pipe framework for later.
* Fixed grav compressors not liking items.
Note: pipes are very buggy, and will get fixed... Eventually... Soon.... Probably not... Maybe...

---- v0.0.006 ----
+ Finalized the grav compressor, only thing left for that is particles, and final velocity tweaks.
+ Finished framework for pads, expect at least 1 more pad in the future. At least. ;)
* Kinda worked out a way to work out if something is worth a version number increment, "Guess".
- Removed uncessary usage.
+ Made some things more efficient.
+ Thinking I should finally make my Ideas.txt file, because I had something awesome planned. Can't remember it. :(
* Fixed some meta bugs.
* Fixed velocity bug.
* Fixed Item's velocity when thrown downward on pad.
+ OH, just remembered the idea. You'll like this one. ;) 


---- v0.0.005 ----
+ Incremented the version number twice.
+ Decrement the version number once.
+ Began framework for something special for later on. :D
- Removed Tooltips, because some things don't deserve them.

---- v0.0.004 ----
+ Incremented the version number.
+ Added Chamber Controller, also share the same ID as the Chamber Walls.
< Pure Colour Blocks now share an ID, not the same ID as Chamber Walls though..
+ Found out how fun it is to add Tool Tips, expect tons more. :)
Notes: Can't really do too much with the same id of Chamber Walls and Pure Colour, I want to keep them separate. 

---- v0.0.003 ----
+ Added Pure Colour, a feature for a later feature.. :P
+ Added Chamber Wall.
+ Added Strengthened Chamber Wall.
+ Added Reinforced Chamber Wall.
+ Added Strengthened Glass.
+ Changed most things about the Chamber Walls, they now share an id.
- Removed an idea I was mucking around with.. Maybe for later? :P
Notes: 

---- v0.0.002 ----
Notes: This is really before I started doing anything, I just wanted to increment the version. :P

---- v0.0.001 ----
Notes: Started most of the shit.
